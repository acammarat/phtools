# phtools
Pre- and post-processing tools for phonon-based calculations.

- [**phonchar**](https://github.com/acammarat/phtools/tree/main/phonchar) Calculate the atomic character of phonon eigenvectors obtained from [PHONOPY](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy)
- [**eigmap**](https://github.com/acammarat/phtools/tree/main/eigmap) Calculate the map between different eigenvector via scalar products
- [**qpoints**](https://github.com/acammarat/phtools/tree/main/qpoints) Extracts phonon eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the file qpoints.yaml generated by [PHONOPY]( https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy)

## Citation
When using these tools, pleace cite the scientific publications as suggested in the relative README.md file.
